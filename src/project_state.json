  "architectural_notes": [
    "Target platform is Android; project should be compatible with Android Studio workflow (open/build/run).",
    "Player jet should be rendered programmatically (e.g., canvas/vector shapes) rather than a static image asset.",
    "Mobile controls should use a virtual joystick; jet orientation/rotation should follow movement direction; on-screen controls should be positioned per spec (joystick left, fire button left).",
    "Bullets should spawn from the jet’s front/nose position and initial velocity should align with the jet’s current facing direction.",
    "Add collision handling outcomes: player-obstacle, bullet-obstacle, and player-border collisions should trigger explosion feedback and transition game state to Game Over.",
    "Obstacle-obstacle collisions should resolve via a reflection/bounce response (reverse or reflect velocity) to separate entities and prevent overlap.",
    "Prefer responsive scaling for mobile: tune sizes of jet/obstacles/bullets/UI so the playfield reads well on small screens."
