{
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root application component that wraps GameScreen with OrientationGuard and applies safe-area insets directly via inline styles for flush-to-edge layout on mobile devices.",
  "frontend/src/game/GameScreen.tsx": "Main game controller with corrected prop names for entity components (rotation instead of angle for PlayerJet/Bullet, removed playfieldSize from Obstacle/Explosion) and fixed collision result property access (newPosition1/2 and newVelocity1/2 instead of positionA/B and velocityA/B).",
  "frontend/src/game/Playfield.tsx": "Playfield container with no outer padding, flush borders (rounded-none), and corner accents positioned with -1px offset to meet border cleanly without gaps.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/PlayerJet.tsx": "Player jet component with reduced mobile base size (w-12 to w-20 across breakpoints) and proportionally scaled thruster flame effects for smaller, more mobile-appropriate visual rendering while preserving rotation and thrust animations.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/GameOverlay.tsx": "Game UI overlay with compact HUD elements (smaller text, reduced padding/spacing), tighter progress bars, and smaller button sizes for mobile-optimized layout.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/bounds.ts": "Utility functions for position clamping, velocity reflection at boundaries, and out-of-bounds detection for percentage-based entity movement.",
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with arcade-themed OKLCH color system, jet thruster animations, explosion keyframes, and removed safe-area utility classes (now handled inline in App.tsx).",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Tailwind configuration extended with game-specific color tokens (game-primary, game-border, game-field, etc.) for consistent theming.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "Placeholder file for React Query hooks; intentionally minimal as game state is fully client-side.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/Bullet.tsx": "Bullet component with reduced visual size (w-1.5 h-3/h-4 instead of w-2 h-5/h-6) and smaller trailing effect for faster, more compact bullet appearance.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/VirtualJoystick.tsx": "Virtual joystick with reduced sizing (w-14 to w-20 across breakpoints) and smaller maxDistance (32px) for compact mobile-friendly touch control.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/Obstacle.tsx": "Obstacle component that accepts size prop (small/medium/large) and optional isBoss prop, rendering a hexagon SVG with size-appropriate scaling and color scheme (red for boss, orange for regular obstacles) with stripes, pulsing core, and warning rings.",
  "frontend/src/game/effects/Explosion.tsx": "Explosion effect component with deterministic rendering supporting three variants: \"hit\" (small spark for bullet impacts), \"player\" (standard explosion), and \"bomb\" (massive multi-layered explosion with larger flash, multiple blast waves, extended ember rings, and heavy smoke for obstacle→player collisions).",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/vectors.ts": "Shared math helpers for converting game facing angles (degrees, 0=up) to normalized forward vectors, converting pixel velocities to playfield-percent deltas with independent width/height scaling, and calculating spawn position offsets along forward direction for bullet muzzle placement.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/obstacleCollisions.ts": "Hardened obstacle-to-obstacle collision physics with epsilon guards for near-zero distances, deterministic fallback normals, always-applied positional separation for overlaps, damped elastic impulse with clamping, and NaN/Infinity protection.",
  "frontend/src/game/utils/levelTimer.ts": "Helper utility for calculating per-level countdown duration (30 + (level-1)*5 seconds) and formatting time display as seconds or mm:ss format.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/playerObstacleHit.ts": "Physics utility that evaluates whether a player-vs-obstacle contact qualifies as a \"full hit\" using overlap depth threshold (40% of smaller radius) to distinguish between grazing contacts and significant impacts that should trigger game over.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/ShootButton.tsx": "Shoot button with reduced sizing (w-14 to w-20 across breakpoints) and proportionally smaller icon for compact mobile landscape layout.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/OrientationGuard.tsx": "Landscape enforcement wrapper that detects portrait orientation, attempts Screen Orientation API lock to landscape with type-safe checking, and displays a blocking overlay with rotation instruction when in portrait mode."
