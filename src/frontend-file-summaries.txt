  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root application component that renders the full-screen game container with the GameScreen component.",
  "frontend/src/game/GameScreen.tsx": "Main game controller with delta-time based movement, continuous firing, obstacle-to-obstacle collision physics using correct CollisionResult property names (newPosition1/2, newVelocity1/2), boss-gated level progression, countdown timer, and per-level obstacle scaling (5 * level) with reduced bullet spawn offset (20px) for closer bullet spawning near the jet nose.",
  "frontend/src/game/Playfield.tsx": "Playfield container with responsive border thickness (border-4 to border-[6px]) and padding (p-4 to p-10) to maximize usable play area on mobile while preserving the bordered arcade aesthetic.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/PlayerJet.tsx": "Player jet component using the generated jet sprite image (jet-player.dim_256x256.png) with animated thruster glow effects (primary glow, flame trail, and core flame) that only render when isThrusting prop is true.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/GameOverlay.tsx": "Game UI overlay with continuous firing via pointer capture, displaying score, level progress with dynamic target (5 * level), boss health bar with clamped values, countdown timer with visual warning when low, and responsive controls for all game states; passes joystick callbacks correctly as single object parameter with onNeutral handler.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/bounds.ts": "Utility functions for position clamping, velocity reflection at boundaries, and out-of-bounds detection for percentage-based entity movement.",
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with arcade-themed OKLCH color system and enhanced jet thruster animations for the new angular plasma cone design (outer/middle/inner flame layers plus side wisps) that only activate when thrusting, plus comprehensive explosion keyframe animations.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Tailwind configuration extended with game-specific color tokens (game-primary, game-border, game-field, etc.) for consistent theming.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "Placeholder file for React Query hooks; intentionally minimal as game state is fully client-side.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/Bullet.tsx": "Bullet component with rotation prop aligned to game's angle convention (0=up, matching PlayerJet) to ensure visual orientation matches travel direction for all facing angles.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/VirtualJoystick.tsx": "Virtual joystick with responsive sizing (w-24 to w-32 across breakpoints) for mobile-friendly touch control while maintaining accurate directional input and visual feedback.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/Obstacle.tsx": "Obstacle component that accepts a size prop (small/medium/large) and renders a hexagon SVG with size-appropriate scaling (0.75x/1.0x/1.25x) while maintaining the existing orange/red hazard theme with stripes, pulsing core, and warning rings.",
  "frontend/src/game/effects/Explosion.tsx": "Explosion effect component with deterministic rendering supporting three variants: \"hit\" (small spark for bullet impacts), \"player\" (standard explosion), and \"bomb\" (massive multi-layered explosion with larger flash, multiple blast waves, extended ember rings, and heavy smoke for obstacle→player collisions).",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/vectors.ts": "Shared math helpers for converting game facing angles (degrees, 0=up) to normalized forward vectors, converting pixel velocities to playfield-percent deltas with independent width/height scaling, and calculating spawn position offsets along forward direction.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/obstacleCollisions.ts": "Obstacle-to-obstacle collision physics helper implementing elastic collision response with velocity reflection and position separation to prevent overlap/jitter between circular obstacles.",
