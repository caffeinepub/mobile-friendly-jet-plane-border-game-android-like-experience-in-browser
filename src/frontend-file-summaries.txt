  "frontend/src/game/GameScreen.tsx": "Main game controller managing spark burst effects alongside existing explosions, spawning spark bursts on bullet→obstacle hits (normal variant), boss deaths (boss variant with stronger effect), and player collisions with obstacles or borders (player variant), with proper timer cleanup, state management for all visual effects, and corrected function signatures for physics utilities and component props.",
  "frontend/src/game/Playfield.tsx": "Playfield container with no outer padding, flush borders (rounded-none), and corner accents positioned with -1px offset to meet border cleanly without gaps.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/PlayerJet.tsx": "Player jet component with reduced mobile base size (w-12 to w-20 across breakpoints) and proportionally scaled thruster flame effects for smaller, more mobile-appropriate visual rendering while preserving rotation and thrust animations.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/GameOverlay.tsx": "Game UI overlay with all text forced to white color throughout HUD, overlays, sensitivity UI, and game state screens, with Progress components now using white-progress-bar className for white fill indicators.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/bounds.ts": "Utility functions for position clamping, velocity reflection at boundaries, out-of-bounds detection, and new isAtBorder helper for detecting when an entity reaches playfield borders for percentage-based entity movement.",
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with arcade-themed OKLCH color system, game-specific shadow utilities, obstacle spark animations (sparkFlicker and sparkPulse), new spark burst impact animations (sparkBurstStreak, sparkBurstFlash, sparkBurstGlow with boss variants), and white progress bar overrides for both light and dark modes.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Tailwind configuration extended with game-specific color tokens (game-primary, game-border, game-field, etc.) for consistent theming.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "Placeholder file for React Query hooks; intentionally minimal as game state is fully client-side.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/Bullet.tsx": "Bullet component with reduced visual size (w-1.5 h-3/h-4 instead of w-2 h-5/h-6) and smaller trailing effect for faster, more compact bullet appearance.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/VirtualJoystick.tsx": "Virtual joystick component with 5-pixel deadzone to prevent micro-movements at neutral, reporting normalized magnitude (0-1) and raw x/y displacement to the game loop for proportional movement control.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/Obstacle.tsx": "Obstacle component that accepts size prop (small/medium/large) and optional isBoss prop, rendering a hexagon SVG with size-appropriate scaling, color scheme (red for boss, orange for regular obstacles), stripes, pulsing core, warning rings, and spark effect overlay.",
  "frontend/src/game/effects/Explosion.tsx": "Explosion effect component with deterministic rendering supporting three variants: \"hit\" (small spark for bullet impacts), \"player\" (standard explosion), and \"bomb\" (massive multi-layered explosion with larger flash, multiple blast waves, extended ember rings, and heavy smoke for obstacle→player collisions).",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/vectors.ts": "Shared math helpers for converting game facing angles (degrees, 0=up) to normalized forward vectors, converting pixel velocities to playfield-percent deltas with independent width/height scaling, and calculating spawn position offsets along forward direction for bullet muzzle placement.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/obstacleCollisions.ts": "Hardened obstacle-to-obstacle collision physics with epsilon guards, deterministic fallback normals, always-applied positional separation, damped elastic impulse with clamping, and comprehensive NaN/Infinity protection with velocity clamping helper to ensure finite, bounded velocities.",
  "frontend/src/game/utils/levelTimer.ts": "Helper utility for calculating per-level countdown duration (30 + (level-1)*5 seconds) and formatting time display as seconds or mm:ss format.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/playerObstacleHit.ts": "Physics utility that evaluates whether a player-vs-obstacle contact qualifies as a \"full hit\" using overlap depth threshold (40% of smaller radius) to distinguish between grazing contacts and significant impacts that should trigger game over.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/ShootButton.tsx": "Shoot button component with pointer capture for continuous fire, now accepting disabled prop to prevent firing when gameState is not 'playing', with proper pointer cancel handling and visual disabled state.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/OrientationGuard.tsx": "Landscape enforcement wrapper with all text rendered in white (text-white) for rotation prompt UI.",
  "frontend/src/game/utils/joystickMovement.ts": "Utility that converts raw joystick input into normalized direction and curved speed factor, applying deadzone (15%), increased speed curve exponent (2.2 for finer control), and reduced max speed multiplier (35% for slower top speed).",
  "frontend/src/game/hooks/useJoystickSensitivity.ts": "React hook managing joystick sensitivity with localStorage persistence, defaulting to 2.0 when no stored value exists or validation fails.",
  "frontend/src/game/effects/ObstacleSparks.tsx": "Visual-only spark effect component that renders animated spark streaks around obstacles with support for boss variant (red-themed sparks and additional glow pulse).",
  "frontend/src/game/effects/SparkBurst.tsx": "Reusable spark burst effect component that renders animated spark streaks radiating outward with central flash and glow, supporting normal, boss, and player variants with different intensities and durations, automatically cleaning up via CSS animations and optional completion callback."
