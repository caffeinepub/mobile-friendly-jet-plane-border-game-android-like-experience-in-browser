{
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root application component that wraps GameScreen with OrientationGuard and applies safe-area insets directly via inline styles for flush-to-edge layout on mobile devices.",
  "frontend/src/game/GameScreen.tsx": "Main game controller with game-over reason tracking ('border', 'obstacle', 'timeExpired'), obstacles and bullets rendered during both 'playing' and 'exploding' states to prevent disappearance during time-expired transitions, and all component props and physics function calls corrected to match their actual signatures.",
  "frontend/src/game/Playfield.tsx": "Playfield container with no outer padding, flush borders (rounded-none), and corner accents positioned with -1px offset to meet border cleanly without gaps.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/PlayerJet.tsx": "Player jet component with reduced mobile base size (w-12 to w-20 across breakpoints) and proportionally scaled thruster flame effects for smaller, more mobile-appropriate visual rendering while preserving rotation and thrust animations.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/GameOverlay.tsx": "Game UI overlay extended with gameOverReason prop, conditionally displaying prominent yellow \"TIME UP!\" message above \"GAME OVER\" text when reason is 'timeExpired', with pulsing animation for emphasis.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/bounds.ts": "Utility functions for position clamping, velocity reflection at boundaries, out-of-bounds detection, and new isAtBorder helper for detecting when an entity reaches playfield borders for percentage-based entity movement.",
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with arcade-themed OKLCH color system, jet thruster animations, explosion keyframes, and removed safe-area utility classes (now handled inline in App.tsx).",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Tailwind configuration extended with game-specific color tokens (game-primary, game-border, game-field, etc.) for consistent theming.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "Placeholder file for React Query hooks; intentionally minimal as game state is fully client-side.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/Bullet.tsx": "Bullet component with reduced visual size (w-1.5 h-3/h-4 instead of w-2 h-5/h-6) and smaller trailing effect for faster, more compact bullet appearance.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/VirtualJoystick.tsx": "Virtual joystick component with 5-pixel deadzone to prevent micro-movements at neutral, reporting normalized magnitude (0-1) and raw x/y displacement to the game loop for proportional movement control.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/Obstacle.tsx": "Obstacle component that accepts size prop (small/medium/large) and optional isBoss prop, rendering a hexagon SVG with size-appropriate scaling and color scheme (red for boss, orange for regular obstacles) with stripes, pulsing core, and warning rings.",
  "frontend/src/game/effects/Explosion.tsx": "Explosion effect component with deterministic rendering supporting three variants: \"hit\" (small spark for bullet impacts), \"player\" (standard explosion), and \"bomb\" (massive multi-layered explosion with larger flash, multiple blast waves, extended ember rings, and heavy smoke for obstacle→player collisions).",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/vectors.ts": "Shared math helpers for converting game facing angles (degrees, 0=up) to normalized forward vectors, converting pixel velocities to playfield-percent deltas with independent width/height scaling, and calculating spawn position offsets along forward direction for bullet muzzle placement.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/obstacleCollisions.ts": "Hardened obstacle-to-obstacle collision physics with epsilon guards, deterministic fallback normals, always-applied positional separation, damped elastic impulse with clamping, and comprehensive NaN/Infinity protection with velocity clamping helper to ensure finite, bounded velocities.",
  "frontend/src/game/utils/levelTimer.ts": "Helper utility for calculating per-level countdown duration (30 + (level-1)*5 seconds) and formatting time display as seconds or mm:ss format.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/playerObstacleHit.ts": "Physics utility that evaluates whether a player-vs-obstacle contact qualifies as a \"full hit\" using overlap depth threshold (40% of smaller radius) to distinguish between grazing contacts and significant impacts that should trigger game over.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/ShootButton.tsx": "Shoot button component with pointer capture for continuous fire, now accepting disabled prop to prevent firing when gameState is not 'playing', with proper pointer cancel handling and visual disabled state.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/OrientationGuard.tsx": "Landscape enforcement wrapper that detects portrait orientation, attempts Screen Orientation API lock to landscape with type-safe checking, and displays a blocking overlay with rotation instruction when in portrait mode.",
  "frontend/src/game/utils/joystickMovement.ts": "Utility that converts raw joystick input into normalized direction and curved speed factor, applying deadzone (15%), increased speed curve exponent (2.2 for finer control), and reduced max speed multiplier (35% for slower top speed).",
  "frontend/src/game/hooks/useJoystickSensitivity.ts": "React hook managing joystick sensitivity with localStorage persistence, defaulting to 2.0 when no stored value exists or validation fails."
