{
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root application component that wraps GameScreen with OrientationGuard to enforce landscape mode on mobile devices.",
  "frontend/src/game/GameScreen.tsx": "Main game controller with firing exclusively controlled via ShootButton callbacks, bullets spawning from jet nose with fixed velocity vectors at fire time for straight-line travel, proper collision detection using correct physics function signatures, and all game state management including level progression and boss encounters.",
  "frontend/src/game/Playfield.tsx": "Playfield container with responsive border thickness (border-4 to border-[6px]) and padding (p-4 to p-10) to maximize usable play area on mobile while preserving the bordered arcade aesthetic.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/PlayerJet.tsx": "Player jet component with UI-rendered SVG shapes and thruster flame effects that render behind the jet body with proper z-index layering, positioned engine-relative and visible at all rotation angles without clipping.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/GameOverlay.tsx": "Game UI overlay with mobile-optimized HUD (smaller panels, reduced padding/text), progress/boss bars constrained to max-width and centered for mobile landscape, and repositioned controls (joystick bottom-right, shoot button bottom-left) scaled down for mobile.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/bounds.ts": "Utility functions for position clamping, velocity reflection at boundaries, and out-of-bounds detection for percentage-based entity movement.",
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with arcade-themed OKLCH color system, jet thruster animations, explosion keyframes, and mobile landscape media query optimizations for compact HUD layout.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Tailwind configuration extended with game-specific color tokens (game-primary, game-border, game-field, etc.) for consistent theming.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "Placeholder file for React Query hooks; intentionally minimal as game state is fully client-side.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/Bullet.tsx": "Bullet component with rotation prop aligned to game's angle convention (0=up, matching PlayerJet) to ensure visual orientation matches travel direction for all facing angles.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/VirtualJoystick.tsx": "Virtual joystick with reduced base sizing (w-20 to w-28 across breakpoints) for mobile-friendly touch control while maintaining accurate directional input and visual feedback.",
  "frontend/src/game/entities/Obstacle.tsx": "Obstacle component that accepts size prop (small/medium/large) and optional isBoss prop, rendering a hexagon SVG with size-appropriate scaling and color scheme (red for boss, orange for regular obstacles) with stripes, pulsing core, and warning rings.",
  "frontend/src/game/effects/Explosion.tsx": "Explosion effect component with deterministic rendering supporting three variants: \"hit\" (small spark for bullet impacts), \"player\" (standard explosion), and \"bomb\" (massive multi-layered explosion with larger flash, multiple blast waves, extended ember rings, and heavy smoke for obstacle→player collisions).",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/vectors.ts": "Shared math helpers for converting game facing angles (degrees, 0=up) to normalized forward vectors, converting pixel velocities to playfield-percent deltas with independent width/height scaling, and calculating spawn position offsets along forward direction for bullet muzzle placement.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/obstacleCollisions.ts": "Hardened obstacle-to-obstacle collision physics with epsilon guards for near-zero distances, deterministic fallback normals, always-applied positional separation for overlaps, damped elastic impulse with clamping, and NaN/Infinity protection.",
  "frontend/src/game/utils/levelTimer.ts": "Helper utility for calculating per-level countdown duration (30 + (level-1)*5 seconds) and formatting time display as seconds or mm:ss format.",
  "frontend/src/game/physics/playerObstacleHit.ts": "Physics utility that evaluates whether a player-vs-obstacle contact qualifies as a \"full hit\" using overlap depth threshold (40% of smaller radius) to distinguish between grazing contacts and significant impacts that should trigger game over.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/ShootButton.tsx": "Dedicated shoot button with reduced sizing (w-16 to w-24 across breakpoints) for mobile landscape, maintaining pointer capture for press-and-hold continuous firing.",
  "frontend/src/game/ui/OrientationGuard.tsx": "Landscape enforcement wrapper that detects portrait orientation, attempts Screen Orientation API lock to landscape with type-safe checking, and displays a blocking overlay with rotation instruction when in portrait mode."
