  "summary": "Diff implements flush-to-edge layout with safe-area padding, refines playfield border/corner accents, and makes HUD/controls more compact. However, there’s insufficient evidence that gameplay bounds/dead-space calculations were updated to match the new border/gap behavior. Diff also includes multiple unrequested gameplay/tuning and visual/theme changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Ensure gameplay bounds and effective playable area match the updated border/gap behavior so there is no extra 'dead space' between the visible border and the area where the player/obstacles can move (adjust playfield padding/bounds calculations accordingly).",
      "reason": "While UI/border layout changes are present, the diff summary does not show any explicit adjustment tying the new visual border thickness/flush layout to the clamping/out-of-bounds/playable-area calculations (e.g., accounting for border thickness or removed padding). The referenced bounds utilities are mentioned generically, but no specific evidence indicates dead-space removal or updated effective bounds matching the new border behavior.",
