  "summary": "Diff updates the PlayerJet rendering to use a jet sprite with thruster effects gated by isThrusting, and adjusts gameplay constants in GameScreen (including reducing BULLET_SPAWN_OFFSET and introducing OBSTACLES_PER_LEVEL = 5). GameOverlay adds pointer-capture based continuous firing behavior. Core REQ goals appear addressed at a high level, but some acceptance-criteria details (e.g., bullet spawn alignment and per-level obstacle target usage in logic/UI) are not fully verifiable from the truncated diff.",
