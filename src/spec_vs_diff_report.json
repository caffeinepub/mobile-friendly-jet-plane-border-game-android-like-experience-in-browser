  "summary": "REQ-24 (hexagon obstacles + orange/red hazard styling + same percentage positioning) appears implemented via an SVG hexagon polygon in Obstacle.tsx while keeping left/top percent + translate(-50%,-50%). REQ-25 (scale down entities/UI for mobile) appears largely implemented via reduced collision constants in GameScreen.tsx and smaller responsive sizes in entity/UI components. REQ-23 (bullet direction snapshot at fire time) appears partially supported by new BulletData.direction/angle and refs in GameScreen.tsx, but the diff summary does not clearly show the bullet spawn being offset to the jet nose (forward offset) at fire time.",

      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Bullets visibly originate from the front/nose of the jet (not from the center or side) across multiple facing angles, using a correct forward spawn offset from the jet nose.",
      "reason": "While GameScreen.tsx introduces JET_NOSE_OFFSET and adds refs for firing snapshots plus bullet direction/angle fields, the provided diff summary is truncated before showing the actual onFire/spawn-position calculation. There is no explicit evidence that bullet spawn positions are computed using the jet's facing angle and a forward/nose offset (as opposed to spawning at the jet center).",
