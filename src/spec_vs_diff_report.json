  "summary": "Diff implements an OrientationGuard overlay with best-effort Screen Orientation API locking, updates PlayerJet thruster rendering to be engine-relative with overflow visible, adds a hardened obstacle collision resolver, and applies multiple mobile UI sizing/spacing changes in the HUD and controls. However, the orientation enforcement appears to block input visually but does not clearly pause/stop gameplay updates while in portrait. Several additional gameplay/rendering refactors (bullets, obstacles, explosions, theming, timers) are described in the diff summaries but were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "When portrait is detected, gameplay is paused/blocked until the device is in landscape (not just an overlay).",
      "reason": "OrientationGuard renders a full-screen overlay when portrait, but the diff summary does not show any mechanism that actually pauses/stops the game loop or game state updates; it only conditionally renders UI over children.",
